# Data Science Salary Analysis

## Overview
This project was completed as part of a Master's in Data Science course.

The goal was to analyze global salary data for Data Scientists and provide a competitive salary recommendation to attract top Senior-level talent, both U.S.-based and globally.

The final deliverables include:
- An exploratory data analysis (EDA) Jupyter Notebook
- Salary range recommendations using Interquartile Range (IQR)
- Visualizations comparing salary distributions by experience level, remote work ratio, and location (U.S. vs Global)
- A PowerPoint presentation summarizing key findings and recommendations for the CEO
